This is an example of how to set up a map, if you uncomment this, the map will work locally and on your own server (AWS, Netlify, etc.) but won't work with GitHub Pages.

{% leaflet_map {"zoom" : 6 } %}

    {% leaflet_marker { "latitude" : 43.2220,
                       "longitude" : 76.8512,
                       "popupContent" : "Mountain quality"} %}
